## About

WeThePeople 
An Unoffical White House We the People peition iPhone app. 

This is an example iPhone app that can be extended by any iPhone Developer who is familar with Objective-C.

## Usage

### A copy of the app will be in the Apple App Store, at the following URL when it is released: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wethepeople/id607912542?ls=1&mt=8


### Download and customize the example source code

  All the source code for this example is available on GitHub here:

    https://github.com/whitehouse/petitions-api-examples


  The only required library for this version of the app is SBJson. 
  I would recomend downloading the example iPhone app, and then using CocoaPods (http://cocoapods.org/) to install that  library. 
  
  To use CocoaPods open your terminal window to the downloaded source code folder and type the following:
  $ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
  $ pod setup
  $ pod install  
  $ open WeThePeople.xcworkspace

  If you don't want to use CocoaPods, feel free to download the SBJson library from http://stig.github.com/json-framework/ and then add it to your app following the directions listed at this address. http://superloopy.io/json-framework/api/3.2/
